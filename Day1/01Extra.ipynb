    "### Collaborating with `git`/`GitHub`\n",
    "\n",
    "`GitHub` is an extremely useful and powerful tool for collaborative work - this will become _even_ more evident when we look at testing and continuous integration (CI) later in the module). Clearly, if you go on to work in any job where you're developing software, you'll need to use version control software in a collaborative manner. Also, you'll need to do this in each of your group projects this year! So lets have a little practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** Items in **bold** have some instructions below to help you out with those steps!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Form teams of, ideally, 3 people (2-4 people is also fine).\n",
    "- Choose **one** members repository (created earlier today) as the repository the whole team will work on.\n",
    "- That member will need to **invite the other members of the team as collaborators**.\n",
    "- Each member should then clone the repository to a suitable location on their machine.\n",
    "- Once cloned, each member should **check out a new (independently named) branch**.\n",
    "- Next, independently, add a new file to the repository (.py, .txt, etc., it doesn't really matter). Add and commit the file to your branch.\n",
    "- **Push this new branch to `GitHub`**.\n",
    "- For your branch, **Create a Pull Request**. Then, as a team, **merge each pull request**.\n",
    "- On your local machines, `git checkout main` and then `git pull` to ensure your `main` branch is up to date with that existing on `GitHub`.\n",
    "- **Delete your old branch** that has now been merged.\n",
    "- Next, each member should (separately) create a new branch (from the up to date `main`). In the `.py` file created previously, each add a new function (anything simple will do, just make sure each function everyone is adding is a little different). When done, commit and then push the new branch to `GitHub`. Create pull requests again. Choose one branch to merge <- _this should work fine_. However, when trying to merge the next branch you'll probably encounter a merge conflict! I'll do a live demo demonstrating _one_ way to handle merge conflicts later, but can you attempt utilise [rebase](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase) to fix this yourselves?"
